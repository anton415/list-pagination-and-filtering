# list-pagination-and-filtering
Project 2 from TreeHouse. List Pagination and Filtering.

----
## Description
In this project, I use a common web development technique known as "pagination" to enhance the usability of a web page.

I start with a page that contains a list of 54 student names, photos and email addresses. I write JavaScript to display 10 names at a time, and add a navigation system -- a series of links at the bottom of the page -- to let users click through the other student entries, 10 at a time.

While making these improvements, I use the principle of "progressive enhancement." The page still display the students' names without JavaScript turned on, but will be much improved (enhanced) with the JavaScript programming I add. In other words, I add JavaScript to paginate and improve the project, without altering the project in such a way that JavaScript is required to use the web page.

My pagination solution work with a list of any number of students, not just with the supplied list of 54 students. This means my solution flexible enough to respond to lists of different lengths.
